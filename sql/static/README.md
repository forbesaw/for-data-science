# SQL for Static Objects
- This directory contains queries to create static objects (tables, stages, pipes) that only need to be updated when changes are made to their build.
- SQL queries are Git tracked here to have a record of how and when these objects are changed.
- Sub-directories correspond to the schema to which the static object belongs.
